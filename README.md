Performance of Waveform Coding Using PCM
 1. Generate a sinusoidal waveform with a DC offset so that it takes only
positive amplitude value.
 2. Sample and quantize the signal using an uniform quantizer with number of
representation levels L. Vary L. Represent each value using decimal to
binary encoder.
 3. Compute the signal-to-noise ratio in dB.
 4. Plot the SNR versus number of bits per symbol. Observe that the SNR
increases linearly.
